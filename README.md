## Submission
To run run.py:
- On Mac/Windows : 
  - Open the Terminal, enter the zipped folder, enter to the folder **./src/**; 
  - To execute in  **./src/**, enter : python run.py;
  - submission.py is generated in *../submit/*;
  - item_feats_SGD.npy and user_feats_SGD.npy are stored in **../data/**.
  
## Codes
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Pandas

> #### Note for running implement_surprise.py, some other libraries are required. Please refer to the script for details.

### Introduction
1. Notebook : 
	- Recommender_MF.ipynb: recorded how we analyzed the user-item ratings matrix and how we implemented the regularized MF and the biased MF. The notebook is organized as follows:
		
		1. Load data, split the ratings matrix into training and testing set
		2. Statistics analysis
		3. Presentation of the MF methods used
		4. Grid search of the best parameters (This part has been reorganized in gs_reg_MF.py and gs_biased_MF.py)
		5. Compute the predictions
		6. Creation of csv file for the submission.

2. Python modules :

    - pre_post_process.py : This module allows us to transform the data of a csv file into a sparse ratings matrix and functions to convert the final made predictions in a csv file of the correct format expected by the Kaggle competition. It contains the following important functions:
							
			- preprocess_data(data):
				Parameters:
				Returns:
				
				
    - run.py : This module executes the program
